 <h1> Pomodoro Timer </h1>
 
 <i>The Pomodoro Technique is a method of managing time developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to divide the work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a tomato referring to the shape of the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cyril used when he was a college student.</i>


<p> All the Code Was written in <strong><i>python</strong></i> using the "tkinter" library for the GUI </p>

 <ul>
 <li>You set the Pomodoro timer (traditionally to 25 minutes).</li>
 <li>You work on the activity.</li>
 <li>The job ends when the timer sounds and a check mark is placed on a sheet of paper.</li>
 <li>if you have fewer than four check marks, take a short break (3 to 5 minutes) and then go back to step 2</li>
 <li>otherwise continue with point 6. After four tomatoes, you can take a longer break (15 to 30 minutes)</li>
 <li>reset the tick count, and go back to step 1.</li>
 </ul>
