# Tomato-Timer
 
 <h1> Pomodoro Timer </h1>
 
 <i>The Pomodoro Technique is a method of managing time developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to divide the work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes long, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a tomato referring to the shape of the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cyril used when he was a college student.</i>
